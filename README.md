# Sentinel

A multi-node wireless sensor network on ESP32. A main hub aggregates motion, distance,
and environmental readings from its own sensors and from a battery-powered remote node
over BLE, and surfaces them on a local display.

The goal is a real distributed embedded system rather than a single-board demo: two
independent firmware images, sensor drivers written from datasheets, FreeRTOS task
scheduling with mutex-protected shared state, and a BLE GATT link between nodes.

## System Architecture

### Main Hub — ESP32 #1
Central monitoring node.

- **PIR motion sensor** — edge detection with debouncing
- **HC-SR04 ultrasonic** — proximity detection, 2–400 cm
- **DHT11** — temperature and humidity via bit-banged 1-Wire
- **LCD1602 over I²C** — live sensor display
- **BLE client** — receives readings from the remote node

### Remote Node — ESP32 #2
Battery-powered satellite sensor.

- **PIR motion sensor** — remote motion detection
- **BLE server** — transmits readings over NimBLE

Each node builds as an independent ESP-IDF project. Drivers used by both nodes live in
the root `components/`, pulled in through each project's `EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`; drivers
used by one node stay under that node.
